# Hackathon Polymer Demo

This repo contains the code from the live 30 minute demo for a April 2017 Hackathon. The code was quickly built from scratch and is not considered quality code, but it a decent clean starting point.

## Setup

Make sure you have npm and bower installed.

Install all dependencies
```
npm install && bower install
```

This will download all the node and Polymer dependencies needed.

## Run

To run the app, make sure you've first set it up. Then run the below command.

```
node server.js
```
